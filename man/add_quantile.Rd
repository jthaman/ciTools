\title{Add Regression Quantiles to Data Frames}
\usage{
add_quantile(tb, fit, p = 0.5, name = NULL, yhatName = "pred", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{tb}{A tibble or data frame of new data.}

\item{fit}{An object of class \code{lm}, \code{glm}, or
\code{lmerMod}. Predictions are made with this object.}

\item{p}{A double. A probability that determines the quantile. Must
be between 0 and 1.}

\item{name}{\code{NULL} or a string. If \code{NULL},
quantiles automatically will be named by \code{add_quantile()},
otherwise, the quantiles will be named \code{name} in the
returned tibble.}

\item{yhatName}{A string. Name of the vector of predictions.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments}
}
\value{
A tibble, \code{tb}, with predicted values and
    level-\emph{p} quantiles attached.
}
\description{
This is a generic function to append regression quantiles to a data
frame. A regression quantile \emph{q} is a point such that
\eqn{Pr(Response | Covariates < q) = p}. These quantiles are
generated for the fitted value of each observation in
\code{tb}. Quantiles are then appended to \code{tb} and returned to
the user as a tibble.
}
\details{
For more specific information about the arguments that are applicable
for each type of model, consult:

\itemize{
  \item \code{\link{add_quantile.lm}} for linear regression response quantiles
  \item \code{\link{add_quantile.glm}} for generalized linear regression response quantiles
  \item \code{\link{add_quantile.lmerMod}} for linear mixed models response quantiles
}

Note: the quantiles that \code{add_quantile} calculates are on the
distribution of \eqn{Y|x}, not \eqn{E[Y|x]}. That is, they use the
same distribution that determines a prediction interval, not the
distribution that determines a confidence interval.

\examples{

# Fit a linear model
fit <- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)

# Find the 0.4 quantile (or 40th percentile) of new distances for
# each observations in cars, conditioned on the linear model.
add_quantile(cars, fit, p = 0.4)

# Fit a Poisson model
fit2 <- glm(dist ~ speed, family = "poisson", data = cars)
# Find the 0.4 quantile (or 40th percentile) of new distances for
# each observation in cars, conditioned on the Poisson model.
add_quantile(cars, fit2, p = 0.4)

# Fit a random intercept linear mixed model
fit3 <- lme4::lmer(Reaction ~ Days + (1|Subject), data = lme4::sleepstudy)
# Find the 0.4 quantile (or 40 percentile) of reaction times for
# each observation in the sleepstudy data. Condition on the model and random effects.
add_quantile(lme4::sleepstudy, fit3, p = 0.4, type = "parametric")
